# FreesoundSimpleSampler
Simple JUCE sampler plugin which demonstrates the use of the freesound-juce API client

Before building it you should duplicate the file `FreesoundSimpleSampler/Source/api_key.example.h`, request a Freesound API key and add it to that file, and rename it to `FreesoundSimpleSampler/Source/api_key.h`.
